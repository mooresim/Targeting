        <h3><u>DIV</u></h3>

        <p>A div is an element with no style and no real purpose. It is ued as just an open container</p>

        <div>GO</div>

        <div>STOP</div>

        <h3><u>DIV</u></h3>

        <p>An ID allows you to target a specific element and attach CSS stylings to JUST THAT ELEMENT WITH THAT ID. 
            In CSS, ids are targeted using the # sign. Ids can be given to ANY ELEMENT.
